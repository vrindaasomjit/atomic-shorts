      "narration": "Welcome to the quantum world, where tiny particles behave strangely. Quantum coherence is when these particles, acting like waves, maintain a stable, synchronized 'rhythm' or phase relationship [3]. This allows them to interfere with each other, either combining to make a stronger wave or canceling out [3].",

      "title": "Decoherence: Losing the Rhythm",
      "narration": "But this delicate synchronization is fragile. Interactions with the environment, like heat or other particles, can disrupt this 'rhythm,' causing the system to lose its coherence â€“ a process called decoherence [1, 3]. This makes quantum systems behave more like everyday objects.",

          "description": "As the grey dots interact, the blue wave becomes increasingly distorted, jumbled, and loses its smooth, predictable shape, eventually breaking down into a fuzzy, undefined cloud of blue particles."
