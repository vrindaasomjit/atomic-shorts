      "title": "Superposition and Interference",
      "narration": "Quantum particles can exist in multiple states at once (superposition) and behave like waves. When coherent, these 'quantum waves' are perfectly in sync, allowing them to interfere and create patterns, like ripples [1], [3].",

      "title": "Decoherence: Losing the Sync",
      "narration": "But this delicate synchronization is fragile. Interactions with the environment, like bumping into other atoms, cause quantum waves to lose alignment. This is decoherence: the quantum 'magic' disappears as the particle settles into a single, definite state [3].",
